RISD DM Fall 2013 Intro to Creative Programming - Lauren M. and Evelyn E.

## Goals
- Teaching them how to learn to code
- "This is how you find out things about how to make things on the web"
- Work through their own design/art ideas

## Tasks
### July 3, 2013
- ~~make github~~
- look up free repos
- think about first few weekly assignments
- think about production environment / ftp / sample html
- this about documentation

## Course Description
JS all the way!!!!

## Approaches
- assignments
- 3 or 4 projects over course
- no weekly assignments
- if we do projects, suggest things
- break the big idea down

## First Six Weeks
- Weekly assignments
- with conceptual challenges

## Week 1
- 30 minutes of crazy stuff
- getting started, FTP
- code as instructions, drawing
- input & response -- mouse position, click, keyboard, map

## Week 2
- HTML/DOM
- variables, operators, control logic (if, for)

## Week 3
- motion -- animation, tween, timers, math (sin, random, noise), transforms
- media -- images, text, svgs

## Week 4

- arrays / dictionaries
- functions

## Week 5

## Frameworks/Agenda
- PaperJS/canvas/sandbox
- FTP
- template pages to drop their code into
- console window/debugging?

- chrome dev tools tricks - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOEw9iiopwI

- then introduce IDEs or other environments as tools

## Structure
- look khan academy structure
- codeacademy?
- or anything else?
- API's
- 6 weeks lectures / 6 weeks unstructured?
- conceptual/technical/studio breakdown?
- open ended project vs. common denominator
- discourse.org?
- https://github.com/edu
- code questions only answered via class mailing list
