- install LightTable
- ~~write to Sue~~
- ~~write back to Lauren's email~~

- ~~see about making a page in fa2013 github repo for class entry point~~ -- instructions to update here https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator. basically just fetch origin and checkout gh-pages branch.

### July 3, 2013
