            Create a composition further exploring the themes you showed in class that reacts to the mouse by transforming between two different states or perspectives, <span style='background:yellow'>both visually and conceptually</span>. That is, your viewer should feel like they are seeing things one way, then upon moving the mouse, arrive at or be confronted with an unexpectedly different perspective. Email the link to a page running your code to Evelyn or Lauren by Wednesday at 11am. Some examples to ponder:

        <a href="#midterm"><p><strong>Midterm: DUE 10/16</strong></p></a>
     
          Midterm review:
          <p>Present a concept sketch, and explain how you envision it developing over the next 6 weeks for the final project. You will have 10 minutes for presentation+feedback, a guest critic will be present to help ask questions. It could be installation, we have green room booked, and room 305 annexes.</p>

          Final project:
          <ul>
            <li>A project that represents 6 (well really 12) weeks of thoughtful work, a process.</li>
            <li>Something that fits into your practice and the ideas you’re working with right now.</li>
            <li>This should not be just a technical demo, we are much more interested in code used in a deliberate, considered way that opens new creative potential for your work. It need not be computer based, but should use programming principles. Think beyond the capabilities of this library, you can use other JS libraries, Java Processing, other??</li>
            <li>Consider (1) relationship of programming to your own work. — How does it allow you to extend? What are the implications of using programming in the way you are choosing? What is unique about this form/medium for you?</li>
            <li>Consider (2) precedents — What has been done already? What areas have not been explored? How are you innovating?</li>
            <li>Consider (3) audience — Who is your desired audience? How will this piece reach them? What is the optimal form? We will work out later as a class best way to view everyone’s work.</li>

        <a href="#timeline"><p><strong>Timeline: DUE 10/23</strong></p></a>

          <p>Please send us any screenshots, pdfs, or links of midterm work.</p>
      
          <p>The next six weeks will be about developing your proposals into the final project, and the structure will be a mix of studio time, individual and group meetings, and some tutorials. See below for the assignment for next week, let us know if you have questions.</p>

          Timeline / project breakdown:
          <p>Take a stab at breaking down your project idea into isolated problems, tasks, or components to figure out. These components may need to be further broken down into subparts. Then make a detailed schedule for the next six weeks. Right now, we are planning on having two weeks of final reviews, more about this later, but for now make your timeline to have your project finished for class on 12/4. We will review individually with you in class this week.</p>

          Things to include:
          <ul>
            <li>High level goals</li>
            <li>Milestones / deadline for each week</li>
            <li>Technical problems that need to be researched and solved</li>
            <li>Important functions/methods that would be useful to implement in your program (specified with return type and input arguments)</li>
            <li>Risks, potential problems or pitfalls</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note that the main deadlines from here on out will be your own. The only thing we are assigning for weds is the timeline, but it would be a good idea this week to continue with technical development of your projects as well!</p>

        <a href="#timeline"><p><strong>Assignment 4: DUE 11/6</strong></p></a>

          <p>Make an index.html page in a folder called /final on your FTP.  Make an entry in the page with your week's progress on your final project.  Include any pictures, text or links that are relevant.  Email the link to Lauren or Evelyn by 11am on 11/06/13.</p>
      
          <p>Read these two articles for discussion next week:<br>
